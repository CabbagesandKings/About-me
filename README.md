# About-me
*Who am I?*
> “At the time, therefore, that I am tir’d with amusement and company, and have indulg’d a reverie in my chamber, or in a solitary walk by a river-side, I feel my mind all collected within itself, and am naturally inclin’d to carry my view into all those subjects, about which I have met with so many disputes in the course of my reading and conversation. I cannot forbear having a curiosity to be acquainted with the principles of moral good and evil, the nature and foundation of government, and the cause of those several passions and inclinations, which actuate and govern me.” (David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I, Part IV, Sec.VIII) 

My name is Ian Johnston. I am currently a student at the university of Ottawa studying Philosophy with a minor in Linguistics. The only coding I've ever done (so far) was in grade 10 computer science and have not done anything since. I've been wanting to get back into practice ever since, but have been impeded by not knowing where to start! In my personal life I enjoy whitewater kayaking, cross country skiing, reading, writing, and cooking. I hope that through Github I'll learn something useful whether it translates into employment or not. If you've read this far, thank you! I appreciate your taking the time to learn about where I am at in life.
